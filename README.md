# GEOGRAPHY 458: Lab 4 by Ryan Danao

**Title:**

The title for Lab 4 would be **Map Design and Tile Generation**. 

**Introduction and Data Sources:**
For this lab, we are tasked to construct 4 tiles sets through QGIS and design our own layers to our map using MapBox. We are also supposed to incorporate data of our choosing for our thematic layer/tile. I chose to look up data on the different hospital locations, and I chose Seattle as the geographic area to base these locations off of. The source of my data would come from the [City of Seattle Open Portal Data](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::hospitals/explore?location=47.461712%2C-122.130100%2C11.20). 

The URL to access the web map that I made would be: https://frenchfryan.github.io/tilegeneration/

**Tile 1: Seattle Basemap**
![Tile 1](/img/Tile%201.jpg)
This tile represents my basemap that shows the geographic area I plan to examine. More specifically, this basemap shows the entire Seattle area and was made on MapBox using the monochrome map layer that was provided. Lastly, the available zoom layers for this tile would be from 1-14.

**Tile 2: Hospital Locations**

This tile represents the thematic layer of the hospital locations around Seattle.The available zoom layers for this tile would be from 1-14.

**Tile 3: Seattle Basemap and Hospital Data**
![Tile 3](/img/Tile%203.jpg)
This tile represents a layer group that consists of the basemap and the thematic layer taken from the first two tiles. The available zoom layers for this tile would be from 1-14.

**Tile 4: Black History Month**
![Tile 4](/img/Tile%204.jpg)
This tile contains a map layer that I designed on MapBox. Furthermore, this tile follows the Black Lives Matter theme by showcasing a variety of different colors used for the movement. The available zoom layers for this tile would be from 1-14.
